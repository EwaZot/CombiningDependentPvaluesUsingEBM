Python 
-------------
The main script for combining P-values is [EmpiricalBrownsMethod.py](../master/Python/EmpiricalBrownsMethod.py). To run some examples, set your working directory to [the Python folder in this repository] (../master/Python) and run WorkFlow.py (execfile('WorkFlow.py')). 

R 
-------------
The main script for combining P-values is [ebm.R](../master/R/ebm.R). To run some examples, set your working directory to [the R folder in this repository] (../master/R) and run WorkFlow.R (source('WorkFlow.R')).

Matlab 
-------------
The main script for combining P-values is [EmpiricalBrownsMethod.m](../master/Matlab/EmpiricalBrownsMethod.m). To run some examples, set your working directory to [the Matlab folder in this repository] (../master/Matlab) and run WorkFlow.m (WorkFlow.m).
