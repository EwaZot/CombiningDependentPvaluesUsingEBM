The files in this folder are for testing implementations of the empirical Brown's Method.

The python implementation of this method is EmpericalBrownsMethod.py

RandomData.tsv contains gaussian random data.
--Independent Var [line 1] are 25 samples from a unit normal distribution.
--Depedent Var 1-10 [line 2-11] are each 25 samples drawn from a 10 dimensional normal distribution centered at the origin with off diagonal terms a=0.25.
--If P values from a pearson correlation between the independent var and each dependent var are combined, the results should be:
----Pbrown = 0.72288173732954353
----Pfisher = 0.86138425703434118
----degrees freedom brown (2f) = 8.1366646038518677
----scale factor c = 2.4580096358564503

Pathways.tsv contains a list of 45 genes that belong to 3 pathways:
--'FOXA1 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NETWORK', 'SUMOYLATION BY RANBP2 REGULATES TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION', 'GLYPICAN 3 NETWORK'

CDH4_Pvalues.tsv contains P values from the spearman correlation between CHD4 and each of the 45 genes from GBM [data from feb 12th 2013].

If the P-values for each set of genes in each pathway are combined using our method or fishers method, the results are:
